h1. Versionable

This Gem provides a way to work with "semantic version numbers":http://semver.org/ in ActiveRecord models.

h2. Installation

Add the following line to your Gemfile and run the @bundle@ command to install it.

<pre>
  gem "versionable"
</pre>

h2. Usage

Call @version_field@ from within an ActiveRecord model class and pass the name of the field to be used as a version number. This field must be of type @Float@.

<pre>
  class Release < ActiveRecord::Base
    version_field :version
  end
</pre>

Versionable now will setup a wrapper around the @version@ field.

* Assigning and retrieving can be done as if the version field were a string:

<pre>
  release.version = '1.2.34'
  # => "1.2.34"

  release.version
  # => "1.2.34"
</pre>

* It is possible to access the value as it's stored in the database through @raw_#{version_field_name}@.

<pre>
  release.raw_version
  # => 0.01002034
</pre>

h2. How does it work?

Versionable internally stores the version number as float using the following simple rule:

_Version X.Y.Z is saved internally as the float value x.xxyyyzzz._

So version 1.2.3 is stored as 0.01002003.

This allows to do SQL searches using the ordering clause.
